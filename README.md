# NekoDNS
Chatops for your DNS records

## Features

Tired of having to navigate through your domain registar's clunky web interface
every time you need to add a new DNS record?

Configure your domain to use NekoDNS-provided name servers (hosted on [AWS Route
53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)) and never struggle with that again!

NekoDNS integrates with your favourite instant messaging platforms, giving you
the convenience of managing your DNS records anytime and anywhere, without
requiring a full-sized web browser.
